# SDFace: Boundary-Aware Face Extraction from FM-Generated Implicit 3D Geometries

This project introduces SDFace, a boundary-aware approach to extracting localized surface
regions (faces) directly from implicit 3D geometries generated by foundation models, eliminating
the need for explicit meshing in finite element analysis (FEA) workflows. Using Signed Distance
Functions (SDFs), SDFace detects zero-crossings, clusters surface normals, and refines results
with gradient and curvature analysis to extract faces suitable for boundary-specific integrations.
Applied to SDFs generated by the Make-a-Shape model, SDFace demonstrates the potential to
integrate implicit geometry pipelines with modern FEA workflows for improved efficiency.
